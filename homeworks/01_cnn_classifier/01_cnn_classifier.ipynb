    "Congratulations, here's your first homework! You'll learn the art of training deep image classifiers. You might remember `03 seminar` about training CIFAR10 classifier, this homework is also about training **CIFAR10 classifier**, but this time you'll have to do it on your own and with some extra features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Your dataset is CIFAR10. Check out `03 seminar` on how to load train and val data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** for training you can only use `train` dataset.\n",

    "## Game rules:\n",
    "Maximum score you can get for this task is **10.0**.\n",

    "Half of 10 points you can get by reaching high val accuracy (as listed in table below):\n",

    "- accuracy > 80.0 -> **3 points**\n",
    "- accuracy > 90.0 -> **4 points**\n",
    "- accuracy > 92.5 -> **5 points**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another half of 10 points you can get by adding following features to your training pipeline. It's okay if you see some technics for the first time (that was the idea). Feel free to google and dive into topic on your own, it's homework after all:\n",
    "1. Data augmentations. Check out [this article](https://medium.com/nanonets/how-to-use-deep-learning-when-you-have-limited-data-part-2-data-augmentation-c26971dc8ced) (**1 point**)\n",
    "2. [LR schedule](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau) (**0.5 point**)\n",
    "3. Finetune pretrained model from [torchvision.models](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) (except AlexNet!) (**1 point**)\n",
    "4. Implement [ResNet model](https://medium.com/@14prakash/understanding-and-implementing-architectures-of-resnet-and-resnext-for-state-of-the-art-image-cf51669e1624) (**2 points**)\n",
    "5. Use of [tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) to monitor training process (**0.5 points**)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result you have to submit **notebook with working code** (results will be reproduced during homework cheking) and **short report** (write it in the same notebook) about things you tried and what tasks you managed to implement. Good luck and have fun!"
